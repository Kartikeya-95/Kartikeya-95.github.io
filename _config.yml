          I'm involved in this project as ML Ops Engineer during client handover phase and handled several data science modules namely Point to Point Pricing, Overbooking, Connecting Pricing, Movable Curtain & Load Factor Forecast modeling for a low cost carrier. I solved numerous client queries, helped them understand the functioning of models, incorporating change requests, monitoring, modifications, automations of models and creation of sector-wise performance monitoring mechanism based on RASK.

          Project in pricing domain that revolved around retail promotion, markdown modeling and stakeholder management.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I was involved in this project during on-going development phase and contributed to implementation and changes to regression discount modeling, redemption modeling, optimizing Baseline, Boost, Uplift model for forecasting sales units and prices at different levels of product hierarchy which resulted in 20% increase in QoQ sales & 5% increase in profit compared to past model performance.

          Challenging Data Science Operations with complex Mathematical Optimization.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I was involved in this project during operations phase ensuring seamless adoption of optimzation results by the stakeholder. I did enhancements in constraints related to capacity, stock volumes, demand, production and automated ingestion of files removing redudancies and streamlining the process as per requirements.

          Solving complex business problems using AI/ML methodologies and packaging them as product
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Refactored and enhanced multiple Data Science modules across domains of Airlines, Retail and Supply Chain to optimize Revenue strategies, leading to improved pricing and performance.

            Optimized Point-to-Point pricing by re-factoring clustering techniques at Sector level and refining dynamic RBD authorization distribution, resulting in better yield management.

            Refactored connecting module, improving connecting share forecasts and adjusting seat availabilities across connecting sectors.

            Refined Load Factor Forecast model and built backtest pipeline enabling the assessment of new model performance on logged inference data by Days from Departure (DFD), ensuring continous model validation.

            Empowered stakeholders by integrating user-defined parameters, optimizing model outputs and providing hands-on guidance for effective model utilization.

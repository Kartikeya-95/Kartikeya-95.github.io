        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            - Refactored and enhanced multiple Data Science modules across domains of Airlines, Retail and Supply Chain to optimize revenue strategies, leading to improved pricing and performance.

            - Optimized load factor forecast model based on departure days buckets, RBD seats allocation distribution, flight sector level clustering resulting in 5% increase in revenue for top 10% domestic sectors.

            - Built load factor backtest pipeline enabling the assessment of new model performance on logged inference data by Days from Departure (DFD), ensuring continous model validation.

            - Integrated new user control parameters in different models, giving user more control towards the output which improved model recommendations adoption by 20%.

            - Created weighted regression model for discount and redemption modeling along with baseline calculation enhancements that resulted in 20% increase in sales & 5% increase in overall revenue.

            - Improved the prediction results for ~2000 new SKUs based on similarity matching using resembling SKUs with enough history & similar characteristics streamlining the launch strategies for new SKUs in the market.

            - Creation & enhancements of business constraints related to stock, capacity, demand & production to align the optimization output with business requirements. 

            - Resolved 50+ ad hoc client queries across multiple projects, ensuring timely model output explanations, data interpretation and business alignment.

            - Extensive collaboration with stakeholders and internal cross functional teams to solve business queries, designing and re-factoring of various machine learning and optimization models.

            - Created several Power BI and Tableau dashboards using different data sources (SQL databases, Flat Files, Sharepoint etc.) for model performance monitoring, adhoc analysis and KPIs reporting.
